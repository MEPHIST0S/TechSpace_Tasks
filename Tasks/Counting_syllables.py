"""
Define a function named count that takes a single parameter. The parameter is a string. 
The string will contain a single word divided into syllables by hyphens, such as these:

"ho-tel"
"cat"
"met-a-phor"
"ter-min-a-tor"
Your function should count the number of syllables and return it.
