"""
The goal of this challenge is to analyze a string to check if it contains two of the same letter in a row. 
For example, the string "hello" has l twice in a row, while the string "nono" does not have two identical letters in a row.

Define a function named double_letters that takes a single parameter. 
The parameter is a string. 
Your function must return True if there are two identical letters in a row in the string, and False otherwise.

        if string[letter] == string[letter - 1]:
            count = 1 
            if count > res:
                res = count
        else:
            count = 0
    return res
