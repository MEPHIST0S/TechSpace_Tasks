"""
Two strings are anagrams if you can make one from the other by rearranging the letters.

Write a function named is_anagram that takes two strings as its parameters. 
Your function should return True if the strings are anagrams, and False otherwise.

For example, the call is_anagram("typhoon", "opython") should 
return True while the call is_anagram("Alice", "Bob") should return False.
