"""
Define a function param_count that takes a variable number of parameters. 
The function should return the number of arguments it was called with.

For example, param_count() should return 0, while param_count(2, 3, 4) should return 3.
"""
def param_count(*args):
    count = 0
    for i in args:
        count += 1
    return count

args = (1, 2, 3)
print(param_count(args))
