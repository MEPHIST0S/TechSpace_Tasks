"""
Here's the backstory for this challenge: imagine you're writing a tic-tac-toe game, where the board looks like this:

1:  X | O | X
   -----------
2:    |   |  
   -----------
3:  O |   |

    A   B  C
The board is represented as a 2D list:

board = [
    ["X", "O", "X"],
    [" ", " ", " "],
    ["O", " ", " "],
]
Imagine if your user enters "C1" and you need to see if there's an X or O in that cell on the board. 
To do so, you need to translate from the string "C1" to row 0 and column 2 so that you can check board[row][column].

Your task is to write a function that can translate from strings of length 2 to a tuple (row, column). 
Name your function get_row_col; 
it should take a single parameter which is a string of length 2 consisting of an uppercase letter and a digit.

For example, calling get_row_col("A3") should return the tuple (2, 0) because A3 corresponds to the row at index 2 and 
column at index 0in the board.

def get_row_col(query):
    res1 = tuple()
    res2 = tuple()
    if query[0] == "A":
        res1 = (0,)
    elif query[0] == "B":
        res1 = (1,)
    elif query[0] == "C":
        res1 = (2,)

    if query[1] == "1":
        res2 = (0,)
    elif query[1] == "2":
        res2 = (1,)
    elif query[1] == "3":
        res2 = (2,)
    res = res2 + res1
    return res

query = "C1"
